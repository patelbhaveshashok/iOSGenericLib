# iOSGenericLib
This is the boiler-plate iOS code which includes the generic/parent classes of UI elementals, block alias, generic enums which will help developers to speedup the development.
You can use this by cloning, and putting the copy in local. Provide the local pod path in your project podfile, example - pod 'iOSLibrary', :path => 'your-local-path/iOSGenericLib/iOSLibrary'.
